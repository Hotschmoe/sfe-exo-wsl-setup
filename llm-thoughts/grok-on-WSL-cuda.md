When installing NVIDIA drivers for use with the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL), you do not need to download or install Linux NVIDIA driver packages within WSL itself. Instead, you only need to install the appropriate NVIDIA driver on the Windows host. Here’s why and how it works:
Key Points:
Windows Host Driver is Sufficient:
WSL relies on the NVIDIA driver installed on the Windows host to provide GPU acceleration, including CUDA support. This driver is automatically mapped into WSL as libcuda.so, enabling GPU functionality without requiring a separate Linux driver installation inside WSL.
Installing a Linux NVIDIA driver within WSL can overwrite this mapping and break GPU passthrough, so it’s explicitly advised against.
What to Install:
On the Windows host, download and install an NVIDIA driver that supports WSL. This is typically a standard NVIDIA driver (e.g., Game Ready or Studio Driver) that includes CUDA and WSL support. You can find these on NVIDIA’s official driver download page (e.g., under GeForce, Quadro, orRTX series, depending on your GPU).
Ensure the driver version supports WSL 2. Most drivers released after mid-2020 (e.g., version 470.xx or later) include this support, but check NVIDIA’s documentation or the driver release notes for confirmation.
No Linux Driver Packages Needed:
You should not download or install Linux-specific NVIDIA driver packages (e.g., those meant for native Ubuntu or other Linux distributions) inside your WSL environment. These are unnecessary and can cause conflicts.
Optional CUDA Toolkit in WSL:
If you need to compile CUDA applications or use CUDA libraries within WSL, you can install the CUDA Toolkit for WSL (available from NVIDIA’s CUDA Toolkit download page). Select the WSL-specific version (e.g., for Ubuntu under WSL), and install only the cuda-toolkit-XX-X metapackage. Avoid meta-packages like cuda or cuda-drivers, as they include the Linux driver and could disrupt WSL’s GPU integration.
Steps to Follow:
Step 1: On your Windows host, download the latest NVIDIA driver compatible with your GPU from NVIDIA’s website (e.g., a Game Ready or Studio Driver). Install it as you would for any Windows system.
Step 2: Verify the driver is installed by running nvidia-smi.exe in a Windows Command Prompt or PowerShell. You should see your GPU details.
Step 3: Ensure WSL 2 is set up with a supported Linux distribution (e.g., Ubuntu). You don’t need to install any NVIDIA drivers inside WSL—GPU support should work out of the box if the Windows driver is recent enough.
Step 4 (Optional): If you need CUDA development tools in WSL, install the WSL-specific CUDA Toolkit from NVIDIA’s site, following their instructions carefully.
Host Requirements:
Windows Version: Windows 10 (version 21H2 or later) or Windows 11.
WSL Kernel: Ensure you’re on a recent WSL 2 kernel (e.g., 5.10.16.3 or later recommended). Update it via Windows Update or manually if needed.
GPU: Pascal architecture or newer (e.g., GTX 10-series, RTX 20/30/40-series) in WDDM mode.
By installing the NVIDIA driver on the Windows host only, you’ll enable GPU acceleration in WSL without any additional Linux driver packages. This setup leverages the tight integration between WSL and the Windows host, making it seamless and efficient.

Based on your WSL output, it looks like nvidia-smi isn’t available in your WSL environment yet, and the system is suggesting you install various nvidia-utils packages. However, as I explained earlier, you should not install these packages inside WSL because they include Linux NVIDIA drivers, which can interfere with WSL’s GPU passthrough from the Windows host. Let’s clarify what you need to do:
What Your Output Means:
The message indicates that no NVIDIA utilities (like nvidia-smi) are currently installed in your WSL Linux distribution (likely Ubuntu 24.04 based on the package versions).
The suggested sudo apt install nvidia-utils-XXX commands would install Linux-specific NVIDIA tools and potentially drivers, which is not the correct approach for WSL.
Correct Approach:
Install the NVIDIA Driver on Windows (Host):
You need to ensure that an NVIDIA driver is installed on your Windows host. This driver provides GPU support to WSL automatically.
Download the latest driver for your GPU from NVIDIA’s website (e.g., Game Ready Driver or Studio Driver) and install it on Windows. For example:
Go to NVIDIA Driver Downloads.
Select your GPU (e.g., GeForce RTX 3060), OS (Windows 10/11), and download a driver (e.g., version 546.33 or later supports WSL well).
After installation, verify it’s working by running nvidia-smi.exe in a Windows Command Prompt or PowerShell. You should see your GPU details (e.g., GPU name, driver version, memory usage).
Check GPU Availability in WSL:
Once the Windows driver is installed, WSL should automatically detect the GPU without any additional driver installation in Linux.
In your WSL terminal, you can test GPU availability with tools like nvidia-smi, but this requires the CUDA Toolkit or a similar package installed in WSL (not the nvidia-utils packages suggested).
Install CUDA Toolkit in WSL (Optional):
If you want nvidia-smi and CUDA functionality (e.g., for development or running GPU-accelerated apps) inside WSL, install the WSL-specific CUDA Toolkit from NVIDIA:
Go to NVIDIA CUDA Toolkit Downloads.
Select “Linux” > “x86_64” > “Ubuntu” > your version (e.g., 24.04) > “WSL-Ubuntu” as the distribution.
Follow the instructions to add the repository and install the cuda-toolkit-XX-X package (e.g., cuda-toolkit-12-6). Avoid installing the full cuda package, as it includes drivers you don’t need.
Example commands (adjust for your version):
bash
wget https://developer.download.nvidia.com/compute/cuda/repos/wsl-ubuntu/x86_64/cuda-wsl-ubuntu.pin
sudo mv cuda-wsl-ubuntu.pin /etc/apt/preferences.d/cuda-repository-pin-600
wget https://developer.download.nvidia.com/compute/cuda/12.6.0/local_installers/cuda-repo-wsl-ubuntu-12-6-local_12.6.0-1_amd64.deb
sudo dpkg -i cuda-repo-wsl-ubuntu-12-6-local_12.6.0-1_amd64.deb
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install cuda-toolkit-12-6
After this, nvidia-smi should be available in WSL and show your GPU details, mirroring what’s on the Windows host.
Verification:
Run nvidia-smi in WSL after installing the CUDA Toolkit. If it works, it confirms that the Windows driver is correctly providing GPU access to WSL.
Example expected output:

Answers to Your Questions:
Do I install CUDA on Windows and it will be available in WSL?
Not exactly. Installing the CUDA Toolkit on Windows (for Windows-native apps) doesn’t automatically make it available in WSL. The Windows NVIDIA driver provides the GPU hardware access to WSL, but if you want CUDA libraries/tools (like nvidia-smi or CUDA development) inside WSL, you need to install the WSL-specific CUDA Toolkit in your WSL distribution as described above.
The Windows driver is the foundation; the WSL CUDA Toolkit is optional for development within WSL.
So what now?
First, ensure the NVIDIA driver is installed on Windows. If it’s not, install it.
If you only need GPU acceleration (e.g., for ML frameworks like TensorFlow/PyTorch), the Windows driver might suffice, as many frameworks can use the GPU via the driver’s libcuda.so integration.
If you need nvidia-smi or CUDA development in WSL, install the WSL CUDA Toolkit.

----------- Windows Install Notes ----------------

Since you're adapting Linux-specific instructions for installing NVIDIA drivers, CUDA Toolkit, and cuDNN for exo-explore to work in the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) on Windows, I’ll provide clear, Windows-focused instructions tailored for WSL users. These steps assume the user has WSL 2 set up with a Linux distribution (e.g., Ubuntu) and an NVIDIA GPU. The goal is to enable GPU support for exo-explore in WSL, mirroring the Linux requirements but accounting for WSL’s unique integration with the Windows host.
Instructions for Installing NVIDIA Driver, CUDA Toolkit, and cuDNN for exo-explore in WSL on Windows
These instructions are for Windows users running WSL 2 who want to set up exo-explore with NVIDIA GPU support. You’ll need a compatible NVIDIA GPU (e.g., GTX 10-series or later) and a supported Windows version (Windows 10 21H2 or later, or Windows 11). Skip any steps you’ve already completed.
Prerequisites
WSL 2 Installed: Ensure WSL 2 is set up with a Linux distribution like Ubuntu. Open PowerShell and run:
wsl --install
Then install Ubuntu from the Microsoft Store if not already done, and launch it to complete the initial setup.
Windows Update: Update Windows to the latest version via Settings > Windows Update to ensure WSL 2 GPU support is available.
Step 1: Install the NVIDIA Driver on Windows
Why: WSL uses the NVIDIA driver installed on the Windows host for GPU access, not a Linux driver within WSL.
How:
Visit the NVIDIA Driver Downloads page.
Select your GPU (e.g., GeForce RTX 3060), operating system (Windows 10 or 11), and driver type (Game Ready or Studio).
Ensure the driver version is recent (e.g., 546.33 or later) for WSL 2 compatibility.
Download and run the installer. Follow the prompts to install the driver.
Restart your computer after installation.
Verify:
Open a Windows Command Prompt or PowerShell and run:
nvidia-smi.exe
You should see a table with your GPU details (e.g., name, driver version, memory usage). If not, reinstall the driver or check your GPU compatibility.
Step 2: Install the CUDA Toolkit in WSL
Why: The CUDA Toolkit provides libraries and tools (like nvcc) needed for GPU-accelerated applications like exo-explore. You install this inside WSL, not Windows.
How:
Open your WSL terminal (e.g., Ubuntu in WSL) by running wsl in PowerShell or launching Ubuntu from the Start menu.
Update your package list:
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
Go to the NVIDIA CUDA Toolkit Downloads page.
Select “Linux” > “x86_64” > your Ubuntu version (e.g., 24.04) > “WSL-Ubuntu” > “deb (local)”.
Follow the provided commands. For example, for CUDA 12.6 on Ubuntu 24.04:
wget https://developer.download.nvidia.com/compute/cuda/repos/wsl-ubuntu/x86_64/cuda-wsl-ubuntu.pin
sudo mv cuda-wsl-ubuntu.pin /etc/apt/preferences.d/cuda-repository-pin-600
wget https://developer.download.nvidia.com/compute/cuda/12.6.0/local_installers/cuda-repo-wsl-ubuntu-12-6-local_12.6.0-1_amd64.deb
sudo dpkg -i cuda-repo-wsl-ubuntu-12-6-local_12.6.0-1_amd64.deb
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y cuda-toolkit-12-6
Important: Install only the cuda-toolkit-XX-X package, not cuda or cuda-drivers, to avoid overwriting WSL’s GPU integration.
Add CUDA to your PATH:
echo 'export PATH=/usr/local/cuda-12.6/bin:$PATH' >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
Verify:
Run:
nvcc --version
You should see output like:
nvcc: NVIDIA (R) Cuda compiler driver
Copyright (c) 2005-2023 NVIDIA Corporation
Built on ...
Cuda compilation tools, release 12.6, V12.6.XX
Step 3: Install the cuDNN Library in WSL
Why: cuDNN provides GPU-accelerated primitives for deep neural networks, which exo-explore might require.
How:
In your WSL terminal, sign up or log in to the NVIDIA Developer Program to access cuDNN downloads.
Go to the cuDNN Download page.
Select a cuDNN version compatible with your CUDA version (e.g., cuDNN 9.0 for CUDA 12.6).
Choose “cuDNN Library for Linux (x86_64)” (not Windows, as this is for WSL’s Linux environment).
Download the .tar.gz file (e.g., cudnn-linux-x86_64-9.0.0.312_cuda12-archive.tar.gz).
Extract and copy the files to your CUDA directory:
tar -xvf cudnn-linux-x86_64-9.0.0.312_cuda12-archive.tar.gz
sudo cp cudnn-*-archive/include/cudnn*.h /usr/local/cuda-12.6/include
sudo cp cudnn-*-archive/lib/libcudnn* /usr/local/cuda-12.6/lib64
sudo chmod a+r /usr/local/cuda-12.6/include/cudnn*.h /usr/local/cuda-12.6/lib64/libcudnn*
Update the library path:
echo 'export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/cuda-12.6/lib64:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH' >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
Verify:
There’s no direct cudnn command to check, but you can confirm installation by running:
ls /usr/local/cuda-12.6/lib64/libcudnn*
You should see files like libcudnn.so.9.0.0. Alternatively, test with nvidia-smi in WSL:
nvidia-smi
This should display GPU info, confirming WSL’s GPU access is working with CUDA and cuDNN in place.
Step 4: Install exo-explore in WSL
How: Assuming exo-explore has specific installation instructions (e.g., via pip, GitHub, or a package manager), follow them within your WSL terminal. For example:
pip install exo-explore
If exo-explore requires specific CUDA/cuDNN versions, ensure they match what you installed (e.g., CUDA 12.6 and cuDNN 9.0).
Verify: Run a test command provided by exo-explore (check its documentation) to confirm GPU support is working.
Notes for Users
Windows Driver Only: Do not install NVIDIA drivers inside WSL (e.g., via apt install nvidia-driver-XXX). This breaks WSL’s GPU passthrough.
Version Compatibility: Check exo-explore’s documentation for required CUDA/cuDNN versions and adjust the above steps if needed (e.g., install CUDA 11.8 instead of 12.6).
Troubleshooting:
If nvidia-smi fails in WSL, ensure the Windows driver is installed and WSL 2 is updated (wsl --update in PowerShell).
If nvcc or libraries aren’t found, double-check your PATH and LD_LIBRARY_PATH settings.
These instructions should enable Windows users to set up exo-explore with NVIDIA GPU support in WSL, paralleling the Linux setup but optimized for WSL’s architecture. Let me know if you need tweaks or if exo-explore has specific requirements I can refine further!
